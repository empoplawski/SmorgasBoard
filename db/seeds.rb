Game.create!(name: "Monopoly", description: "Theme<br/>Players take the part of land owners, attempting to buy and then develop their land. Income is gained by other players visiting their properties and money is spent when they visit properties belonging to other players. When times get tough, players may have to mortgage their properties to raise cash for fines, taxes and other misfortunes.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>On his turn, a player rolls two dice and moves that number of spaces around the board. If the player lands on an as-yet-unowned property, he has the opportunity to buy it and add it to his portfolio or allow the bank to auction it to the highest bidder. If a player owns all the spaces within a color group, he may then build houses and hotels on these spaces, generating even more income from opponents who land there. If he lands on a property owned by another player, he must pay that player rent according to the value of the land and any buildings on it. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.<br/><br/>Goal<br/>The goal of the game is to be the last player remaining with any money.<br/><br/>Cultural impact on rules<br/>Monopoly is unusual in that the game has official, printed rules, but most players learn how to play from others, never actually learning the correct way to play. This has led to the canonization of a number of house rules that make the game more palatable to children (and sore losers) but harm the gameplay by preventing players from going bankrupt or slowing down the rate of property acquisition. One common house rule has players put any money paid to the bank in the center of the board, which jackpot a player may earn by landing on Free Parking. This prevents the game from removing money from play, and since players collect $200 each time they pass Go, this results in ever-increasing bankrolls and players surviving rents that should have bankrupted them. Another house rule allows players to take &quot;loans&quot; from the bank instead of going bankrupt, which means the game will never end. Some house rules arise out of ignorance rather than attempts to improve the game. For instance, many players don't know that properties landed on but left unbought go up for auction, and even some that know to auction don't know that the bidding starts at $1, meaning a player may pay well below the listed price for an auctioned property.<br/><br/>Background<br/>In the USA in 1933, Charles Darrow devised Monopoly based on an earlier game by Elizabeth J. Magie. The patent was filed 31st August 1935 while the game was on sale in America. Based on an earlier game, The Landlord's Game, it was at first rejected by Parker Bros., as being too complicated to be a success. How wrong could they be! It came to the UK in 1936, made under licence by Waddingtons. Darrow died in 1967 having realised he had developed one of the most successful board games of all times. It was awarded as Game of the Century by the TRA (Toy Retailers Association).<br/><br/>Monopoly was patented in 1935 by Charles Darrow and released by Parker Brothers. The game was actually one of a number of variants in existence at the time, all of which date back to an earlier, 1904 game by Elizabeth J. Magie called The Landlord's Game. Magie was a proponent of the Single Tax put forth by famous author Henry George.  The game was designed to show the evils of earning money from renting land (as it leads to the destitution of all but one player) and the virtues of the proposed Single Tax - players could choose to play under regular rules or alternate &quot;Single Tax&quot; rules.<br/><br/>The game didn't really go anywhere and Magie lost interest in it. Variations of the game evolved, however, and homemade versions traveled up and down the Atlantic coast and even as far west as Michigan and Texas, being developed all along the way. Eventually the game was noticed by Charles Darrow, who introduced it to the world in its current form.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    The Landlord's Game<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/>Official<br/><br/>    Monopoly Stock Exchange Add-on<br/>    Monopoly Free Parking Mini Game<br/>    Monopoly Get Out of Jail Mini Game<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Unofficial<br/><br/>    Super Add-ons: Monopoly<br/>    Entrepreneur's Accessory to Monopoly<br/>    Game Spice: Monopoly Expansion<br/>    Mafiopoly<br/>    Monopoly: Mob Rule Expansion Deck<br/>    Final Fantasy Monopoly<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", category: "family", player_num: "2-8", playing_time: "180", year_created: "1933", image_url: "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3640835.jpg")

As the days grew longer and the weather grew hotter, Princess Celestia realized it was getting closer and closer to the Summer Sun Celebration. But there was so much to prepare in Equestria! So, she did what any good leader would do: she delegated! And now you and your friends can play as Ponies as you help prepare Equestria for the party in My Little Pony Game of Life.<br/><br/>My Little Pony Game of Life sets players on a course preparing Equestria, but also learning the importance of friendship. You'll gain friends and earn Friendship Points, which will help you overcome obstacles, find supplies for the celebration, and get back to Ponyville in enough time to party down. Plus, you get four collectible Pony pieces, different from (but in the same scale as) the pieces in My Little Pony Monopoly (so all the Ponies can play together). My Little Pony Game of Life proves that the most important things in life are the friends you make along your journey through it.

In this version, at the end of each turn, a new card is drawn from the deck to replace the card that was played, so that each player is always working from five cards.<br/><br/>A player's fortunes can change dramatically in one or two rounds of play through the use of Sorry cards, the &quot;11&quot; cards (which give the player the option of trading places with an opponent's piece on the track), and the fact that it is possible to move from Start to Home without circumnavigating the full board by making judicious use of the &quot;backward 4&quot; cards.<br/><br/>", "thumbnail"=>"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1187187_t.jpg", "image"=>"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1187187.jpg", "boardgameartist"=>"(Uncredited)", "boardgameversion"=>["Basic Fun keychain edition", "BCM De Luxe First Edition", "BCM Double Pack First Edition", "BCM edition", "BCM first edition", "Borras Spanish edition", "Borras Spanish edition 1980", "Copp Clark edition 1938", "Editrice Dark Blue Edition", "Estrela Brazilian Edition", "First edition", "Game Office Portuguese Edition", "Grow Edition", "Hasbro / Parker Brothers Retro Games Edition", "Hasbro Canadian bilingual edition", "Hasbro English edition 1992", "Hasbro English edition 2008", "Hasbro Family Game Night Edition", "Hasbro Retro metallic box version", "Hasbro Star Wars edition", "Hasbro Target Exclusive edition", "John Waddington Edition 1951", "John Waddington Edition 1969", "Juegos Crone Spanish edition", "Nilco Greek Edition", "Parker Brothers \"Family Game Night\" edition 2001", "Parker Brothers \"Family Game Night\" edition 2005", "Parker Brothers / General Mills Fun Group edition", "Parker Brothers / Hasbro edition", "Parker Brothers 70th Birthday edition", "Parker Brothers Australia / New Zealand edition", "Parker Brothers edition 1934", "Parker Brothers edition 1958", "Parker Brothers Edition 1964", "Parker Brothers edition 1992", "Parker Brothers Nostalgia Games Series", "Parker Brothers Small Box edition 1939", "Parker Brothers Travel Edition", "Parker Brothers Vintage Collection wooden book edition", "Parker Brothers Vintage Collection wooden box edition", "Parker German edition 1980", "Parker-Brohm German Edition", "Waddington Classic Children's Edition", "Waddingtons 1970's Edition", "Waddingtons edition 1977", "Waddingtons edition 1983", "Waddingtons Look Learn and Play Edition", "Winning Moves \"Classic\" Edition"], "boardgamepublisher"=>["Basic Fun, Inc.", "Borras Plana S.A.", "Brohm-Parker-Spiele", "Copp Clark Publishing Company", "Editrice Giochi", "Estrela", "Game Office", "General Mills", "Grow Jogos e Brinquedos", "Hasbro", "Hausser", "John Waddington Ltd.", "Juegos Crone", "Murfett Australia", "Nilco S.A.", "Parker Brothers", "W.

The object is to be the first player to reach the candy castle. There are specific directions to play. You can play with one color block, two color blocks and picture cards.

And now you and your friends can play as Ponies as you help prepare Equestria for the party in My Little Pony Game of Life.<br/><br/>My Little Pony Game of Life sets players on a course preparing Equestria, but also learning the importance of friendship. You'll gain friends and earn Friendship Points, which will help you overcome obstacles, find supplies for the celebration, and get back to Ponyville in enough time to party down. Plus, you get four collectible Pony pieces, different from (but in the same scale as) the pieces in My Little Pony Monopoly (so all the Ponies can play together).

The twist is, no-one knows which pawn you control, or which character it represents. At the start of the game each player is given a colour card and a character card, kept secret from the other players. Unowned colours and characters are still in play, not controlled by any player. Each turn players can choose to move any pawn they wish, not just the colour they control. When you move a pawn into a space that's already occupied, you may choose one player (or unowned group of colour and character cards) and ask to see their colour. If that colour pawn is present in the space you just moved to, you may ask to see their character card. You cannot reveal this information to the other players. Once this phase is complete, anyone who controls a pawn in that same space may reveal their colour and character cards to everyone and start a fight.

(Hasta Donde Puedas)", "​ Karty proti lidskosti"], "description"=>"&quot;A party game for horrible people.&quot;<br/><br/>Play begins with a judge, known as the &quot;Card Czar&quot;, choosing a black question or fill-in-the-blank card from the top of the deck and showing it to all players.  Each player holds a hand of ten white answer cards at the beginning of each round, and passes a card (sometimes two) to the Card Czar, face-down, representing their answer to the question on the card. The card czar determines which answer card(s) are funniest in the context of the question or fill-in-the-blank card. The player who submitted the chosen card(s) is given the question card to represent an &quot;Awesome Point&quot;, and then the player to the left of the new Card Czar becomes the new Czar for the next round. Play continues until the players agree to stop, at which point the player with the most Awesome Points is the winner.<br/><br/>This, so far, sounds like the popular and fairly inoffensive Apples to Apples. While the games are similar, the sense of humor required is very different. The game encourages players to poke fun at practically every awkward or taboo subject including race, religion, gender, poverty, torture, alcoholism, drugs, sex (oh yes), abortion, child abuse, celebrities, and those everyday little annoyances like &quot;Expecting a burp and vomiting on the floor&quot;.<br/><br/>In addition, there are a few extra rules.  First, some question cards are &quot;Pick 2&quot; or cards, which require each participant to submit two cards in sequence to complete their answer. Second, a gambling component also exists.  If a question is played which a player believes they have two possible winning answers for, they may bet an Awesome Point to play a single second answer.

The pencil and paper grids were changed to plastic grids with holes that could hold plastic pegs used to record the guesses.<br/><br/>Each player deploys his ships (of lengths varying from 2 to 5 squares) secretly on a square grid.  Then each player shoots at the other's grid by calling a location.  The defender responds by &quot;Hit!&quot; or &quot;Miss!&quot;.  You try to deduce where the enemy ships are and sink them.  First to do so wins.<br/><br/>The Salvo variant listed in the rules allows each player to call out from 1 to 5 shots at a time depending on the amount of ships the player has left (IE: players each start off with 5 ships, so they start off with 5 shots.  As ships are sunk, the players gets fewer shots).  This version of the game is closer to the original pencil-and-paper public domain game.  Many versions of the pencil-and-paper game have different amounts of shots based on the ship (IE: Battleship: 5 shots.

If you are sloppy and touch the metal sides of the hole where the item is located, the patient's pain is indicated by a sudden buzzer and light-up nose.  Successful extractions net cash, and the player with the most cash at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>Various editions change the patient and the items to be removed, but the game stays the same in its essence:<br/><br/>     Shrek -- just like the classic version, but with Shrek.<br/>     Simpsons -- Remove Homer's Bowler's Thumb, Pot Belly, Foot in Mouth, Rubber Neck, Trick Knee, etc.<br/>     T-Rex -- excavating bones of a T.

If the mousetrap doesn't malfunction, the mouse is captured and out of the game.  The winner is the last mouse who avoids being trapped.

Карточная игра", "卡坦島紙牌版"], "description"=>"Catan Card Game bears only a slight resemblance to The Settlers of Catan, the original game in the Catan series.  There are six resources: wool, wood, bricks, grain, ore, and gold. Before beginning the game, the players receive six square cards showing the resources, with a different die number on each card. In addition, the players start the game with two village cards and a road card connecting them. There are card stacks of more roads and villages, as well as cities, to be purchased during the game. With each new village or city comes two new resource cards. Villages and cities give victory points.<br/><br/>When the number die is rolled, instead of collecting more cards, the players rotate the corresponding card 90 degrees to indicate a gain of one more of that resource; i.e., the brick card shows a picture of one brick on one edge of the card, two bricks on the next clockwise edge, three bricks along the third edge, and zero bricks on the fourth edge. There is also an event die, with five possible outcomes:<br/><br/><br/>     a reward for the player with more knight points or more 'windmill' points (a picture of a windmill on some cards),<br/>     a bonus resource,<br/>     an attack if a player has too many resources, and<br/>     one of six special events - civil war, conflict, master builder, plague, productive year, or progress.     <br/><br/><br/>There are 62 expansion cards in six stacks in the center of the table. Before beginning the game, players choose one stack, go through it, and choose three cards to hold in their hands. Forty-two of the expansion cards require spending resources to be put into play, gaining civic improvements or knights. Every civic improvement serves some useful function or adds victory points or both. Twenty of the cards are actions benefiting one of the players or harming the other. After a player pays to put a card down or uses an action card, he blindly draws a replacement. Unwanted or unusable cards can be traded in future turns. Some of the cards have flags on them, indicating victory points.<br/><br/>Whoever first has twelve victory points wins the game!<br/><br/>", "thumbnail"=>"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic135066_t.jpg", "image"=>"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic135066.jpg", "boardgamepublisher"=>["KOSMOS", "999 Games", "Competo / Marektoy", "Devir", "Filosofia Éditions", "Galakta", "Giochi Uniti", "Laser plus", "Mayfair Games", "Piatnik", "Smart Ltd", "Tilsit"], "boardgamehonor"=>["1997 Deutscher Spiele Preis Best Family/Adult Game 2nd Place", "1997 Fairplay À la carte Winner", "1997 Spiel des Jahres Recommended"], "boardgamemechanic"=>["Card Drafting", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Trading"], "boardgamecategory"=>["Card Game", "City Building", "Territory Building"], "boardgamefamily"=>["Catan", "Die Siedler von Catan: Das Kartenspiel / Catan Card Game", "Kosmos two-player series"], "videogamebg"=>["Catan (2007)", "Catan (2017 / Mobile)"], "boardgameexpansion"=>["Catan Card Game: Artisans & Benefactors", "Catan Card Game: Barbarians & Traders Upgrade Kit", "Catan Card Game: Expansion Set", "De Kolonisten van Catan: Het Kaartspel – Goud & Piraten", "Die Siedler von Catan: Das Kartenspiel – Sonderkarte 2002 – Johanna, die Kriegerin", "Die Siedler von Catan: Das Kartenspiel – Sonderkarte 2003 – Guido, der große Diplomat", "Die Siedler von Catan: Das Kartenspiel – Sonderkarte 2004 – Benjamin, der treue Vasall", "Die Siedler von Catan: Das Kartenspiel – Sonderkarte 2005 – Irmgard, Bewahrerin des Lichts", "Die Siedler von Catan: Das Kartenspiel – Sonderkarte 2006 – Emi'Ly, Bewahrerin der Harmonie", "Die Siedler von Catan: Das Kartenspiel – Sonderkarte 2007 – Arnd, der findige Knappe", "Die Siedler von Catan: Das Kartenspiel – Sonderkarte 2008 – Gustav und Reiner, Helfer der Ratlosen", "Die Siedler von Catan: Das Kartenspiel – Sonderkarte 2009 – Franz vohm Winkel", "Die Siedler von Catan: Das Turnier-Set zum Kartenspiel", "Die Siedler von Catan: Kartenspiel – Handel & Wandel", "Die Siedler von Catan: Kartenspiel – Kämpfer & Kaufleute", "Die Siedler von Catan: Kartenspiel – Magier & Forscher", "Die Siedler von Catan: Kartenspiel – Politik & Intrige", "Die Siedler von Catan: Kartenspiel – Ritter & Händler", "Die Siedler von Catan: Kartenspiel – Wissenschaft & Fortschritt", "Die Siedler von Catan: Kartenspiel – Zauberer & Drachen"], "boardgameartist"=>["Tanja Donner", "Pete Fenlon", "Jason Hawkins", "Matt Schwabel", "Klaus Teuber", "Franz Vohwinkel", "Stephen Graham Walsh"], "boardgameversion"=>["Dutch First Edition", "Dutch Second Edition", "Dutch Third Edition", "English first edition", "English revised edition 2005", "English Revised edition 2007", "Finnish edition 2005", "French edition 2002", "French edition 2006", "German edition 2006", "German edition 2007", "German first edition 1996", "German Jubiläumsausgabe edition", "German second edition 1997 with SdJ logo", "German Third edition", "Hungarian edition", "Hungarian edition 2006", "Italian edition 2002", "Polish edition", "Romanian first edition", "Russian first edition", "Russian second edition", "Slovenian first edition", "Slovenian Second Edition", "Spanish edition"], "boardgamepodcastepisode"=>"Episode #38: Two Player Games", "boardgameimplementation"=>"The Rivals for Catan", "boardgamecompilation"=>"Die Siedler von Catan: Das Kartenspiel – 10th Anniversary Special Edition Tin Box", "boardgamesubdomain"=>"Strategy Games", "boardgamedesigner"=>"Klaus Teuber", "poll"=>[{"name"=>"suggested_numplayers", "title"=>"User Suggested Number of Players", "totalvotes"=>"83", "results"=>[{"numplayers"=>"1", "result"=>[{"value"=>"Best", "numvotes"=>"0"}, {"value"=>"Recommended", "numvotes"=>"1"}, {"value"=>"Not Recommended", "numvotes"=>"64"}]}, {"numplayers"=>"2", "result"=>[{"value"=>"Best", "numvotes"=>"77"}, {"value"=>"Recommended", "numvotes"=>"4"}, {"value"=>"Not Recommended", "numvotes"=>"1"}]}, {"numplayers"=>"2+", "result"=>[{"value"=>"Best", "numvotes"=>"1"}, {"value"=>"Recommended", "numvotes"=>"3"}, {"value"=>"Not Recommended", "numvotes"=>"55"}]}]}, {"name"=>"language_dependence", "title"=>"Language Dependence", "totalvotes"=>"39", "results"=>{"result"=>[{"level"=>"1", "value"=>"No necessary in-game text", "numvotes"=>"0"}, {"level"=>"2", "value"=>"Some necessary text -
